I started doing the zerotomastery advent challenge to improve my coding skills, and I wanted to add the readme to include notes on what I learned for the challenge this day. 
1. I learned that if you use ctrl + a you can select all text in a document. Combining the ctrl + a trick with ctrl + alt + i will let you add characters to every line of code.
2. I shouldn't need to use the console.log except for two reasons. First I should use the console to debug my code, and second I should use it to display the answer. The reason being that I had to use the console to get the values of sumList while it is easier to just store the values inside of another list. 
3. PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON:  DON'T COMMIT NEW CODE DIRECTLY INTO THE MAIN BRANCH. First make another branch to commit the changes into, once you have verified that the changes are correct and don't break your code, then you can commit to the main branch.
